abstract:
  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that aims to render physically realistic
  images. Ray tracing is computationally intense and is therefore mostly used
  for offline rendering.
  Diagrams is a flexible and powerful DSL for vector graphics written in Haskell.
  It allows to define 3D scenes.
  This thesis wants to replace POV-Ray as standard 3D Backend of Diagrams by implementing
  a ray tracer in the functional language Haskell. It provides details about the
  design and implementation.
