abstract:
  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that aims to render physically realistic
  images. Ray tracing is computationally intense and is therefore mostly used
  for offline rendering.
  Diagrams is a flexible and powerful DSL for vector graphics written in Haskell.
  It allows to define 3D scenes.
  This thesis aims to replace POV-Ray as standard 3D Backend of Diagrams by implementing
  a ray tracer in the functional language Haskell. It provides details about the
  used primitives, describes the intersection functions and how to apply
  transformations to the scene. The implementation uses the Blinn-Phong
  shading model and descibes the different color computations. Also a comparison
  with POV-Ray is given.
